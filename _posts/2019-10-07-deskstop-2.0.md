title: Desk setup 2.0

Recently I re-organised my desk with new monitor and new Rife stand.

Below the picture of my desk 1.0, it was rather a primitive setup were I had a single monitor(ViewSonic) with [amazon basics stand](https://www.amazon.in/AmazonBasics-DSN-01396-BK2-Monitor-Stand-Black/dp/B017DOS5C0/) which costs roughly about 11 dollars, with VGA to thunderbolt adapter(Bit of a mess I know :P).

Below is the picture of my new desk 2.0, were I replaced the amazon basics stand with the new [Rife](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B077RHZMFB/) dual monitor desk mount(45 dollars), and bought a new ultra wide [LG monitor](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B01MG52X3Y/), magic keyboard and magic mouse for the all the wireless iMac sort of experience.Also cleared all the unwanted stuff from top of my desk to get more space, kept it minimalistic.

I seldomly use vertical second monitor because my mac(mid 2012) can support only one display at a time, but I can use it for other devices like raspberry pi.
